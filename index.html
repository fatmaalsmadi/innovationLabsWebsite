<h3>Clubhouse History</h3>
<p>
    Princess Basma Youth Resource Centre is a leading national resource centre for youth issues. The youth empowerment centre strives for young Jordanian voices to be heard while aiding their active participation in public life.
    The Centre also seeks to provide the opportunity, support, resources and freedom for youth to express their needs and shape new realities for their future while thinking creatively and critically about themselves and their roles in society.
    Many of the PBYRC programmes are designed for youth and by the youth. PBYRC works with young people aged 10-24 from across the Kingdom.
    Its focus for this segment of society is particularly crucial to Jordan because nearly 60 per cent of the population is recorded to be less than 25 years of age.
